Published-Papers-and-Poster

Here I have both copies of the two academic papers I am on. 
The first is the paper I wrote from my research in graduate school 
(which is also in the "writing-samples" repository), 
and the second is a preprint version of the paper resulting from 
research done in undergrad. 

Also here is the Poster presented in January 2020 at the American 
Astronomical Society Meeting (AAS).
